      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>You are holding a booklet that contains the “Dig & Discover” principles taught by WordPartners as we seek to elevate God’s life-giving Word in the hearts, lives, and ministries of pastors and their people.</p>

      <h3>Why this booklet?</h3>
      <p>We believe God’s Word gives life.</p>

      <blockquote>
        Man shall not live by bread alone,<br>
        but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.<br>
        &mdash; Matthew 4:4
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        The law of the LORD is perfect,<br>
        reviving the soul;<br>
        the testimony of the LORD is sure,<br>
        making wise the simple;<br>
        the precepts of the LORD are right,<br>
        rejoicing the heart;<br>
        the commandment of the LORD is pure,<br>
        enlightening the eyes;<br>
        the fear of the LORD is clean,<br>
        enduring forever;<br>
        the rules of the LORD are true,<br>
        and righteous altogether.<br>
        More to be desired are they than gold,<br>
        even much fine gold;<br>
        sweeter also than honey<br>
        and drippings of the honeycomb.<br>
        Moreover, by them is your servant warned;<br>
        in keeping them there is great reward.<br>
        &mdash; Psalm 19:7-11
      </blockquote>

      <p>When God’s living Word is faithfully proclaimed, its life goes deep and spreads wide. Our vision is <strong>“to see the Word of God flowing powerfully through every church to every nation.”</strong></p>

      <p>The principles in this booklet are key to that desire. They are designed to help us understand and be transformed by the living Word of God and to bring that transformation to others. They are integral in multiplying pastors who train pastors to preach God’s Word with God’s heart.</p>

      <h3>What will this booklet do?</h3>
      <p>These principles will help us:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>become better readers of God’s Word;</li>
        <li>be transformed by God’s Word;</li>
        <li>grow in confidence and skill in proclaiming God’s Word; and</li>
        <li>shepherd others with the transformation God is seeking.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The goal is to become better at preaching God’s Word in an expository way.</p>

      <p><strong>What is expository preaching?</strong> Put simply, expository preaching means that the transformational message of the text of Scripture is the point of the sermon.</p>

      <h3>How is this booklet designed?</h3>
      <p>It begins with a conviction, “The Line.” The task of the preacher or teacher is to stay on the line of God’s Word. The principles that follow discipline us to live out that conviction and lead us to the author’s main idea and transformational intent which we will proclaim.</p>

      <p>Reflecting on the principles of Biblical Theology and Text and Framework in relation to the intent will increase our ability to proclaim the glories of Christ in a way that challenges our culture.</p>

      <p>Taken as a whole, these principles help us to construct a sermon that proclaims the author’s message and shepherds the listeners with the transformation God intends.</p>

      <h3>A Benefit and a Caution</h3>
      <p>The benefit of a booklet like this is that it lifts the burden from the preacher. He no longer needs to depend upon his own ingenuity but instead has the necessary tools to confidently and faithfully proclaim the living Word of God.</p>

      <p>However, this booklet also comes with a caution. Preaching God’s Word can never be reduced to just a set of principles. We must use these, or any others, as servants to the process of <strong>transformation</strong>. The preacher who proclaims God’s Word in humble and profound dependence on God’s Spirit will be God’s instrument of life and will bring glory to His name.</p>
