      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>You are holding a booklet that contains the “Dig & Discover” principles taught by WordPartners as we seek to elevate God’s life-giving Word in the hearts, lives, and ministries of pastors and their people.</p>

      <h3>Why this booklet?</h3>
      <p>We believe God’s Word gives life.</p>

      <blockquote>
        Man shall not live by bread alone,<br>
        but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.<br>
        &mdash; Matthew 4:4
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        The law of the LORD is perfect,<br>
        reviving the soul;<br>
        the testimony of the LORD is sure,<br>
        making wise the simple;<br>
        the precepts of the LORD are right,<br>
        rejoicing the heart;<br>
        the commandment of the LORD is pure,<br>
        enlightening the eyes;<br>
        the fear of the LORD is clean,<br>
        enduring forever;<br>
        the rules of the LORD are true,<br>
        and righteous altogether.<br>
        More to be desired are they than gold,<br>
        even much fine gold;<br>
        sweeter also than honey<br>
        and drippings of the honeycomb.<br>
        Moreover, by them is your servant warned;<br>
        in keeping them there is great reward.<br>
        &mdash; Psalm 19:7-11
      </blockquote>

      <p>When God’s living Word is faithfully proclaimed, its life goes deep and spreads wide. Our vision is <strong>“to see the Word of God flowing powerfully through every church to every nation.”</strong></p>

      <p>The principles in this booklet are key to that desire. They are designed to help us understand and be transformed by the living Word of God and to bring that transformation to others. They are integral in multiplying pastors who train pastors to preach God’s Word with God’s heart.</p>

      <h3>What will this booklet do?</h3>
      <p>These principles will help us:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>become better readers of God’s Word;</li>
        <li>be transformed by God’s Word;</li>
        <li>grow in confidence and skill in proclaiming God’s Word; and</li>
        <li>shepherd others with the transformation God is seeking.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The goal is to become better at preaching God’s Word in an expository way.</p>

      <p><strong>What is expository preaching?</strong> Put simply, expository preaching means that the transformational message of the text of Scripture is the point of the sermon.</p>

      <h3>How is this booklet designed?</h3>
      <p>It begins with a conviction, “The Line.” The task of the preacher or teacher is to stay on the line of God’s Word. The principles that follow discipline us to live out that conviction and lead us to the author’s main idea and transformational intent which we will proclaim.</p>

      <p>Reflecting on the principles of Biblical Theology and Text and Framework in relation to the intent will increase our ability to proclaim the glories of Christ in a way that challenges our culture.</p>

      <p>Taken as a whole, these principles help us to construct a sermon that proclaims the author’s message and shepherds the listeners with the transformation God intends.</p>

      <h3>A Benefit and a Caution</h3>
      <p>The benefit of a booklet like this is that it lifts the burden from the preacher. He no longer needs to depend upon his own ingenuity but instead has the necessary tools to confidently and faithfully proclaim the living Word of God.</p>

      <p>However, this booklet also comes with a caution. Preaching God’s Word can never be reduced to just a set of principles. We must use these, or any others, as servants to the process of <strong>transformation</strong>. The preacher who proclaims God’s Word in humble and profound dependence on God’s Spirit will be God’s instrument of life and will bring glory to His name.</p>

      <h2>The Line</h2>
      <h3>What does this mean?</h3>
      <p>The line represents God’s Word. The task of the preacher or teacher is to stay on the line. He is not to go above it, saying more than what God says, or go below it, saying less than what God says. He is to stay on the line by saying what God says.</p>
      <h3>How does this work?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>In many countries, before one can testify in a court of law, he must take an oath: “Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God?” A faithful witness will not say more than the truth or less than the truth. He will say the truth.</li>
        <li>To go above the line and say more is to add to what God has said. This is the error of legalism.</li>
        <li>To go below the line and say less is to subtract from what God has said. This is the error of liberalism and license.</li>
        <li>Adding to or subtracting from the line can sound different, but they share the same fundamental problem: they are off the line and distort what God has said.</li>
        <li>Preaching and teaching God’s Word require that we carefully listen to what God has said. (See especially Deuteronomy 4:1–2; Proverbs 30:5–6; Revelation 22:18–19.)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Why is this important?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>God has spoken. God is a speaking God. From the beginning of time, his sovereign words have proved powerful to bring life.</li>
        <li>It is written. God recorded his Word. In time God worked through men to preserve his words for every generation.</li>
        <li>Preach the Word. God commands that his Word be proclaimed. God made it clear that his spokesmen are to say what he has said – nothing more and nothing less.</li>
        <li>This Word is your life. God gives life through his Word. Our words, opinions, and thoughts have no power to transform lives. God’s Spirit works through God’s Word to spread his peace and joy and the hope of eternal life to his people.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="good-questions">
      <h2>Good Questions</h2>
      <h3>What does this mean?</h3>
      <p>A good question leads us down the path of the author and helps us discover his intent.</p>
      <h3>How does this work?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The author is leading us down a path to his destination (his intent). Good questions lead us down that path.</li>
        <li>Our questions may be interesting but will take us off course. We must be careful and answer good questions and not just interesting ones.</li>
        <li>Good questions are imperative for making good observations about the text.</li>
        <li>There are two types of good questions: basic and powerful.</li>
        <li>Basic questions form an essential foundation and starting point. They are about information and ideas in the text. These questions are about who, what, when, and where.</li>
        <li>Powerful questions go beyond basic ones. They help us understand the reasoning and intent of the text. These questions are about why and how.</li>
        <li>Begin by asking basic questions, then be sure to move to more powerful ones.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Why is this important?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Powerful questions require more curiosity, perseverance, and skill.</li>
        <li>This is the starting point for staying on the line and is a skill used in all the principles that follow.</li>
        <li>It leads to astute, sharp observations that get to the main idea and transformational intent of the author.</li>
        <li>It helps our preaching move beyond ideas and information <em>about</em> the text to the precise message and change that God desires <em>from</em> the text.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="genre">
      <h2>Genre</h2>
      <p><strong>What does this mean?</strong><br>
      In literature, genre is a specific kind, or type, of writing.</p>
      <p><strong>How does this work?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Different types of fruit have distinct characteristics, and we approach each one differently to eat it. Different genres of Scripture each have distinct characteristics, and we approach each one differently as we study.</li>
        <li>Different genres include story (narrative), poetry, letter, etc.</li>
        <li>We recognize and approach them on their terms by their nature and design.</li>
        <li>The Bible includes many types of genres. We can classify each book primarily as one genre (for example, letter), but may include subgenres (for example, the genealogies of Genesis are part of narrative) or other genres (for example, epistles have poetry).</li>
        <li>There is a spectrum that compares the way language is used in several types of genre. While genre tends to lean in one direction or the other, it may also include characteristics on the other side of the spectrum.</li>
        <li>The author intentionally chose the genre to suit his message and purpose.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Tone and Mood</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Embedded in every message is the author’s tone; his attitude toward his topic. He may write with joy, encouragement, rebuke, sorrow, or other attitudes. Tone is expressed in writing through the descriptions, verbs, and expressions the author uses.</li>
        <li>The author intentionally uses tone through the genre to create a mood in the reader. This mood is the attitude the author intended for the reader to respond with. For example, the author may use a tone of rebuke intending a response of repentance from the reader, or he may use a tone of joy to create thanksgiving or encouragement in the reader.</li>
        <li>The intended transformation is not just our actions but our attitudes, also.</li>
        <li><strong>Why is tone and mood important?</strong> Preaching from any genre must be done with the author’s tone and aimed at creating the intended mood in the hearer in order to shepherd the transformation God intends.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is one of the first questions that must be asked, because it leads to a natural and correct understanding of the author’s message, purpose, and tone.</li>
        <li>It guides us to see the structure inherent in the text.</li>
        <li>It builds our skill to proclaim God’s Word in a way that captures and clarifies the author’s message, purpose, and tone.</li>
      </ul>
